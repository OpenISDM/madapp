This package contains the necessary components to fetch GeoJSON files containing shelter information from a particular server,
 and display them in different formats. Current implementation provides two views. A map view and a list view. User only
 needs to host the fragments, MapFragment and ShelterListFragment, in their activity to obtain the corresponding views.
 User can host one fragment, or multiple of them.

The fragments are only responsible for providing the basic view layout. Without fetching the GEOJSON files,
they will show no shelter information.

Before fetching the files,  user needs to call JSONBroadcastReceiverManager.register() in the
hosting activity(preferably in onCreate() or onStart()). When the Fragments(MapFragment and ShelterListFragment) has been
initiated and added to FragmentManager, insert the Fragment objects into the list of receiver using
JSONBroadcastReceiverManager.addReceiver(JSONReceiver).

After the BroadcastReceiver has been setup, user can then select the GEOJSON server source with ShelterSourceSelector.selectShelterSource(int),
and finally fetch the files with ShelterSourceSelector.fetchFromServer(). User can change the source anytime
during the lifetime of the hosting activity. For instance, the source can be changed in the onClick event
of a Button.

When the hosting activity fades into background, user may also wish to unregister broadcast receiver with JSONBroadcastReceiverManager.unregister() (preferrably in onStop() or onPause()).
